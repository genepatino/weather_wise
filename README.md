<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>WeatherWise is a weather app that will initially show a charging status, while verifying whether or not previously saved information exists in the Local Storage. If not, it accesses the user's location to show the weather details of their city. The user will be able to change the metric temperature units through a Switch (initially, it will be displayed in ÂºC), as well as the language of the application (Spanish, by default) using two buttons ("ES", "IN"). A warning message will be displayed in case the information entered by the user does not match a city, or does not meet the minimum number of inhabitants (city: from 50,000 inhabitants). The city data entered by the user will be stored in the localStorage for data persistence.<p>

<p>Initially you will see an input in which you must enter a city, this input has a <em>debounce</em> that waits 1 sec before making the query to the API.</p>
<p>In the "Rain Variation" bar section, and the "Rain Probability" card, the Math.random() function was implemented, since it was not data sent by the API; as well as the image temperature graph.</p>
